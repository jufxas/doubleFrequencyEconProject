		<a class="nameTitles">Kevin Diggs</a>
		<div id="establishEthos">
			<span
				>Kevin Diggs is a 23-year-old graduate of Princeton University. He
				earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering within his four
				years of attending the school and had taken AP Calculus, AP Computer
				Science, and AP Chemistry in his high school, Frank J. Cicarell
				Elizabeth High School, and in college. Kevin was a salutatorian in his
				AP classes in college and had dreamed of starting his own company to
				where he could put his education to use. Throughout his 4 years of
				college, along with studying for the classes he was taking, he would
				also research, blueprint, and discover what was needed to start the
				headphone manufacturing company of his dreams. When Kevin had graduated
				college, he began his job hunt and after one month, was able to maintain
				a job as electronics engineer for Goodlite Product Inc., making $21 an
				hour. While Kevin was working at his job, whenever he had spare time, he
				would build prototypes of potential wired and wireless headphones and
				earbuds. After a year of working at his job, Kevin quit so that he could
				devote the majority of his time working on constructing a pair of
				headphones that he deemed perfect. Kevin spent 5 months straight on this
				task and in total, Kevin had made over 120 blueprints and 50
				prototypes/models of headphones. Five months prior to the official start
				of Double Frequency, Kevin joined a team of people with similar mindsets
				so that he could start the company and produce wired/wireless earbuds
				and headphones. Four months later, the team was ready to start the
				manufacture of the product.

		<a class="nameTitles">Angel Sosa</a>
		<div id="establishEthos">
			<span
				>Angel Sosa was not able to enroll into college due to the poverty his
				family and he were facing. He took up 3 jobs in order to provide and
				maintain his family needs, which made him motivated to pursue a higher
				education in engineering in hopes of starting a company and getting
				rich. After 6 years of community college classes pertaining to
				mechanical engineering, Angel was approached by his high school friend
				Kevin Diggs while out eating. After talking about what they did after
				high school, Kevin offered Angel an opportunity to help start-up a
				headphone company named Double Frequency with him. Angel quickly
				accepted with hopes of achieving his dreams of wealth and supporting his
				family, and it paid off. He joined the team as the Quality Control
				manager. The team of Jazlyn, Unique, Kevin, and Angel, quickly drew up
				business propositions and possible prototypes of their future product.
				After months of deliberation, their product was ready to hit the market
				and be released to the world.

		<a class="nameTitles">Unique Acevedo </a>
		<div id="establishEthos">
			<span
				>Unique Acevedo tried his hardest to live up to his name his entire
				life: Unique. After joining many social clubs throughout his high school
				years, taking many AP classes, and participating in hundreds of
				community organized events, Unique found that helping and informing
				others was his gift. Unique graduated from the MIT Sloan School of
				Management with a bachelor's degree in marketing. After college, Unique
				approached a variety of jobs: a business teacher, a social media
				manager, a reporter, etc. All in all, none of them seem to fit his wants
				and needs. However, everything changed the day that Kevin Diggs, an old
				student, an old friend from Unique’s AP Calculus class back in high
				school, approached him at one of the community’s social events. He
				explained to Unique that he was starting his own business and wanted his
				social skills and marketing experience on his team. A lightbulb flashed
				above Unique’s head; he knew this was the opportunity he’s been dreaming
				of for so long. Business marketing was perfect for Unique, considering
				he had a degree in marketing after all. He would be their Marketing
				Manager. After their entire team was assembled, and 4 months of hard
				work and planning had passed, their business had been ready and would be
				spread across the world. Their company, Double Frequency, would not stop
				for anyone.

		<a class="nameTitles">Jazlyn Sacoto</a>
		<div id="establishEthos">
			<span
				>Jazlyn Sacoto lived in a normal middle-class household until one day
				there was a fire that burned down the house and they were left with
				minimum items. Jazlyn began to work 2 jobs on the weekdays and another
				full-time job on the weekends to help her family pull through. She had
				to balance out school and work which was very stressful. She took as
				many AP classes as allowed so she can go to a good college, and in the
				end, it was all worth it. She made it into community college with a
				scholarship and studied business and accounting for four years and
				graduated with a master’s degree. She looked for careers within that
				field, but nothing seemed right. One day she went out to a job
				convention and happened to bump into Kevin, who she used to have some of
				her AP classes with. They caught up on life and Kevin then offered
				Jazlyn an opportunity to join him in a wireless headphone startup as the
				accountant. Jazlyn gladly took the opportunity and saw it as a sign. It
				grew into a wonderful team including Kevin Diggs, Angel Sosa, and Unique
				Acevedo. A few months after the product was ready to be put on the
				market. Jazlyn and her team were successful, and Jazlyn was able to give
				her family the life they deserved, and it was worth everything.​
